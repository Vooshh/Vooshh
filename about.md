- 👋 Hi, I’m @Vooshh
- 👀 I’m interested in learning web development but I am currently banging my head against the various methods, technologies, stacks, languages, you know... all that choice.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I am not great at staying focused.  Maybe I need to write a list.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Static Site Generation, Navigation and Design.
- 📫 How to reach me HoppetyVoosh@gmail.com
